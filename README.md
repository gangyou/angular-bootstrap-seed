# angular-bootstrap-seed â€” the seed for AngularJS & Bootstrap apps

fork from [angular/angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed)

This project is an application skeleton for a typical [AngularJS 1.x](http://angularjs.org/) with [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com) web app.

You can use it to quickly bootstrap you webapp with angular's powerful support for interactive and bootstrap's styling. Under the `app/js` directory, a recommended directory structure is builded for more orgnization.

As the angular-seed project, this project doesn't do much, just integrate the two outstanding frameworks.

## Getting Started

To get you started, just visit the [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) prjects, the steps is all the same.

For impatient readers, just run `npm install && npm start` will be helpfull.
